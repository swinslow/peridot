1) WEBAPP: user goes to login link
2) API: => /auth/login => API sends redirect to Github OAuth
3) Github: user logs in via Github
4) Github: user is redirected back to API
5) API: => /auth/redirect => API calls Github; confirms code and
   gets username; creates JWT; sends HTML with JS to save in
   localstorage and immediately redirect to /
   [QUERY: does this save in localstorage that webapp can access?]
6) WEBAPP: checks localstorage, notices that JWT is present,
   uses it to access API

If someone wants to access the API directly, they can view the
JWT in the webapp and use it for API calls.
